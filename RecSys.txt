2. NEIGHBOURHOOD BASED COLLABORATIVE FILTERING
-------------------------------------------

- Leveraging behaviour of other users to know what you might enjoy.
- Finding people like you and recommend stuff they liked
- Or, recommending stuff that other people bought after buying what you have bought.


PRODUCE SIMILAR ITEMS/PEOPLE
----------------------------

- STEP 1: Measure similarity between things or similarity between people
		- Similarity Metrics (Cosine Similarity)
		- Big challenge on measuring similarities based behaviour data - "SPARSITY"
			- There are so many movies that most of the movies aren't watched.
			- It is tough to work with collaborative filtering unless we have lots of behaviour data
			- We can not perform cossine similarity if no items/people are in common. In other words,
			  how can we find similarity if there is nothing in similar?
