-------------------------

There many real world challenges for recommender systems 


	- Cold Start Problem
	- Stoplists
	- Filter Bubbles
	- Transparancy and Trust
	- Outliers
	- Gaming the system
	- Implicit data - Explicit problems
	- International laws and Markets
	- Dealing with time
	- Value aware recommendations



1. COLD START PROBLEM
-----------------------

	-> new user (what to recommend?)
	-> new items (Whom to recommend?)

	SOLUTIONS - New User
	i. Use implict data
	ii. Browser cookies - To identify users
	    User Sessions
	iii. Geo-IP
		- Similar items for similar geography may seem absurd idea but
		  it is better than recommending nothing. 
		- Moreover, think about people buying more sweat shirts in north 
		  than equators or think about seasonal products
	iv. Recommend top sellers / do promotions
	v. Interview the user
		- Was used by Netflix 
		- Pintrest

	SOLUTIONS - New Items
	i. Just don't worry about it
		- May show up in search results / someone may search it because of promotions
		- In practice, perfectly reasonable. But some researchers proposed other 
		  solutions listed below
	ii. Content based Recommendations
		- Using it alone is not a good idea
		- Augment user behaviour data with this - Solves the cold start problem right there
	iii. Map content attributes to hidden features found by matrix factorisation / deep learning
	     and use user behaviour data as a support
		- Complicated idea (eg. learnAROMA)
	iv. Random Exploration
		- Attempt to use random slots for recommendations to gather more information
		- Not really a good approach



2. STOPLISTS
-------------

	REMEBER: It is easier to offend people without intending to even do so

	MAIN IDEA: Stoplists are just used to not recomment unwanted or bad items.

	In 2006, Walmart's website paired 'Martin Luther King' with lots of different movies including
	movies like 'Planet of the apes'
 		- Many didn't like it
		- Walmart had to apologize and donate significant amount of money
		- Scraped entire Recommendations system (Probalbly people might have lost jobs!)
	
	There are topics too touchy for us to deal with. This arises STOPLISTS

	- Based on some keywords (in title or description or category) our recommendation system shouldn't 
	  even know the items exist! (Avoid them to get into training process)

	Note: You don't want to endup on front page of newspaper!

	- Some keywords include topics pertaining to
		- Adult content
		- Vulgarity
		- Legally prohibited topics
		- Terrorism / Political extremism
		- Bereavement / Medical
		- Drug use
		- Religion

	- Trump example - "Played" with Recommendation System


3. FILTER BUBBLES
-----------------

	- Societal problems that arise when you show people things that appeal to their "existing interests"!
		eg. I am stuck with BeYouNick
	
	- It is called filter bubble because the content to be presented is filtered such that it keeps them
	  'within bubble of pre-existing interests'

	SOLUTION
	-> 'Extra' diversity can help them get out of bubble



4. TRANSPARANCY AND TRUST
-------------------------
	Note: Both are inter-related

	- Make sure your users recognize atleast some of top N recommendations
	- Allow transparancy to gain more trust - "Why you recommended an item must be made visible"
		- But when deaing with Matrix factorisation(Latent Features) or Deep Learning, it can't
		  be communicated to user why an item was recommended
		- Good thing but leads to more work


5. OUTLIERS
-------------

	Not only restricted to RecSys but it is a general problem
	
	- Results are as good as data you feed into model
	- Filter out outliers that might skew your results in unnatural ways
		- What if a bot tries to "play" with ratings impacting recommendations significantly?
		- Not always malicious behaviour, it might be a web crawler polluting your data or your own 
		  internal tools
		- People who review items for living
		- Institutional buyers 

	[FIND OUT OUTLIERS]

	[UNDERSTAND THEM]

		V
	[FILTER THEM OUT]



6. GAMING THE SYSTEM
---------------------

	- If recommendations cause greater purchase, makers of items look for ways to game your system into
	  recommending their item more / not recommending others' items
	- Hacker may do it for the sake of just doing it out of amusement
	- eg. Google Bombs

	SOLUTION
	
	i. Only consider people who spent real money on item
		- Voting with wallets is a stong indication of interest
	ii. If no purchase data, you can still take precautions 
		- eg. star review from people whopurchased / consumed items
	iii. If you allow people to rate items they actually haven't seen/used - you are open to attacks
	iv. Using click data should be your last choice. As it is trivially easy to fake it
		"Always be wary of click-data"
		Even not from bots, click-data has it's own set of problems



7. IMPLICIT DATA - EXPLICIT PROBLEMS
------------------------------------
	
	- Implicit data - eg. clickstream like clicks on images
		- Fraught with problems
		- Be extermely skeptical about building recommendation system that solely depend on click data
			It is an experienced advice that click-data is
				 	- Susceptible to gaming
					- Has human behaviour problems

	"If you ever build a system that recommend products based on product images that people click on when
	 they see them in online ad; I promise you that what you build  will end up as pornogrphy detection system.
	There won't be anything you can do about it even if you try to filter sexual content, you will be lead
	to things with sexual anatomy!"
