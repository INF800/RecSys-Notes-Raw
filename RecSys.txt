2. NEIGHBOURHOOD BASED COLLABORATIVE FILTERING
-------------------------------------------

- Leveraging behaviour of other users to know what you might enjoy.
- Finding people like you and recommend stuff they liked
- Or, recommending stuff that other people bought after buying what you have bought.


PRODUCE SIMILAR ITEMS/PEOPLE
----------------------------
Measuring similarity between things or similarity between people
		- Similarity Metrics (Cosine Similarity)
		- Big challenge on measuring similarities based behaviour data - "SPARSITY"
			- There are so many movies that most of the movies aren't watched.
			- It is tough to work with collaborative filtering unless we have lots of behaviour data
			- We can not perform cossine similarity if no items/people are in common. In other words,
			  how can we find similarity if there is nothing in similar? 
			- Storing sparse data consumes a lot of space. This problem is solved with sparse arrays
		- QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF DATA IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ALGORITHM WE CHOSE


OTHER WAYS TO COMPUTE SIMILARITY
--------------------------------
	- Cosine Similarity Metric
	- Adjusted Cosine Similarity
	- Pearson Similarity 
	- Spearman Rank Correlation
	- MSD Similarity
	- Jaccard Similarity
