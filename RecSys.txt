-----------------------

- Collaborative filtering applied to recommender system for "Rating Predictions"


	[Candidade Generation] <-----------> [RANKING PREDICTION]
		   |
		   |
		   V
	   [CANDIDATE RANKIMG]
		   |
		   |
		   V
	      [FILTERING]
		   |
		   |
		   V
     [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []
	       Top-N-List  


This obviously is a terribly efficient approach. But since we are predicting rating values, we can measure
offline accuracy of system using Test/Train or Cross-Validation - Useful in research world!




User Based KNN
---------------

	[Find k most similar users who rated this item]
			      |
			      |
			      V
	[Compute mean similarity scoreweighted by ratings]
			      |
			      |
			      V
		      [Rating Prediction]


- Still uses user-user similarity matrix at it's core
- We are reaching deeper into data and trying to make rating predictions
- Complex approach - Which is a bad thing!!
