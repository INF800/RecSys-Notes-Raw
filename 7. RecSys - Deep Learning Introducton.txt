-----------------

IS DEEPLEARNING A OVERKILL?

	- Just because new tech is hot, it doesn't mean it is right soultion for every problem
	- DL is shows good performance in
		- Actions similar to our brain
		- Image recognition
		- Series/Pattern recognition
	- Neural nets are fundamentally matrix operations (proved by TF). And there are already well established 
	  matrix factorisation techniques for recommendation systems that fundamentally do something similar.
	  eg. SVD - We find matrices using weights calculated by SGD! (Simailar to DL)

Hence, DL CAN BE APPLIED TO RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS
	- It is just some kind of pattern recognition where people are involved.
	- Amazon opensourced neural nets based DSSTNE (where huge neural nets deal with sparse data)
	- Even by small margins, in some researches DL outperformed SVD
