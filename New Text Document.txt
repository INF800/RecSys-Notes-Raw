-----------------------

- Collaborative filtering applied to recommender system for "Rating Predictions"


	[Candidade Generation] <-----------> [RANKING PREDICTION]
		   |
		   |
		   V
	   [CANDIDATE RANKIMG]
		   |
		   |
		   V
	      [FILTERING]
		   |
		   |
		   V
     [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []
	       Top-N-List  


This obviously is a terribly efficient approach. But since we are predicting rating values, we can measure
offline accuracy of system using Test/Train or Cross-Validation - Useful in research world!




User Based KNN
---------------

	[Find k most similar users who rated this item]
			      |
			      |
			      V
	[Compute mean similarity scoreweighted by ratings]
			      |
			      |
			      V
		      [Rating Prediction]


- Still uses user-user similarity matrix at it's core
- We are reaching deeper into data and trying to make rating predictions
- Complex approach - Which is a bad thing!!


[FORMULA]




Item Based KNN
---------------

	[Finding k most similar items also rated by this user]
				|
				|
				V
	  [Compute mean similarity score weighted by ratings]
				|
				|
				V
		       [Rating Predictions]


[Formula]
	- Better off with smaller approach
	- This is more like shoveling into framework

Note: Above all, offline metrics cannot be pure base line for choosing one framework




TRANSLATION BASED RECOMMENDATION(2017)
--------------------------------------
 - Watched tom cruise 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4th tom cruise
		- Outperforms all other methods (Hit Rate)
		- Bleeding edge (Promising)
		- Code and data available
