4. MATRIX FACTORISATION
------------------------

- Collaborative filtering is a good method. Even for ... . So, why alternative approach?	
	- It is sensitive to NOISE DATA and SPARSE DATA
	- Good results only if
		- Large dataset
		- Nice and clean


MODEL BASED METHOD
------------------

- Instead of finding items or users similar to each other apply ML and DS
	- Train our Model with data
	- Predict using Model


Matrix Factorisation
---------------------

- It has many sub categories of techniques
- CREEPY! Manages to find broader feature of users/items on their own (eg. Actioin or Romantic) although math
  doesn't know what to call newly found features - Just described by matrices


MAIN IDEA: Describe users and items as combinations of different amounts of each other.
		eg. Bob = 50% Action and 20% Comedy
		- Matching movies with these attributes - Good for predicting



SPARSE MATRIC ---> CHALLENGE --> PCA




Principal Component Analysis
-----------------------------

- Dimentionality reduction (Can't say what newly-reduced-dimensions mean)
- Feature extraction tool


PCA on User Ratings
--------------------

	PCA can boil down user-item rating matrix much smaller dimensions that best
	describes VARIANCE in data

- Often, the dimensions they find correspond to features humans have learnt to associate with items (eg. Acton-ey)
- Whatever it is about movies that causes individuals to rate them differently, PCA extracts and finds those
  'Latent Features'

Note: if R (Orignal Matrix) has some missing values, we can reconstruct R by filling blank values!!
      R = M Sigma(U-Transpose)
